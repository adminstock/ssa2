# SmallServerAdminV2

This is evolution of [SmallServerAdmin](https://github.com/adminstock/ssa).

Work on the first version will continue separately.

## Idea

The first version of [SmallServerAdmin](https://github.com/adminstock/ssa) is poor implementation of front-end and unnecessary back-end.

The main purpose - is to simplify the code.

The client application will be implemented on **TypeScript** using **ReactJS**.

On the server side will only **API**.

The client application and the **API** will be completely independent.

It is planned to add support for other operating systems.

To begin, we need to make all the features of the first version.

## Participation in the project

The project welcomes new participants.
